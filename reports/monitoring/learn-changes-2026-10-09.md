+Important
+This feature is part of
+Frontier preview program
+. Frontier connects you directly with Microsoftâs latest AI innovations. Frontier previews are subject to the existing preview terms of your customer agreements. As these features are still in development, their availability and capabilities may change over time.
+When you create or edit a connection to a supported platform, you can control whether Microsoft 365 collects observability data for the agents synchronized from that platform. This setting appears as
+Collect agent observability data
+in the connection dialog.
+To check whether observability data collection is available for a platform, see
+the
+Observability
+column in
+Supported platforms
+.
+When you enable this setting, Microsoft 365 retrieves agent activity telemetryâsuch as agent sessions, usage, and related operational signalsâfrom the connected platform by using the connection's stored credentials. This telemetry powers the agent
+Activity
+experience in the Microsoft 365 admin center and
+Defender Alerts & insights
+, giving you centralized visibility into how your synchronized agents are used.
+New connections have this setting enabled by default. Existing connections that you created before the setting was available continue to collect observability data until you change it.
+To change the setting:
+Open the
+Connected platforms
+page in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
+Create a new connection, or select an existing connection and edit it.
+Select or clear
+Collect agent observability data
+.
+Save the connection.
+Note
+Retrieving agent telemetry from the connected platform might query the provider's own logging or data services (for example, Google BigQuery or Amazon S3) and can incur data access or query charges that the provider bills. R

**What Changed:**
```diff
--- +++ @@ -28,7 +28,6 @@ Restricted Content Discovery is a site-level setting. When you turn on the setting, Microsoft 365 search systems propagate it so that content from the site doesn't appear in organization-wide discovery experiences.
 Even when Restricted Content Discovery is enabled:
 Site permissions stay the same.
-Users can continue to access content they already have permission to access.
 Users can still discover content they own or have recently interacted with.
 The feature doesn't remove content from the Microsoft 365 search index.
 Because the setting must propagate across indexing systems, updates can take time to become fully effective. The amount of time depends on site size, the number of files in each site, and the number of concurrent updates being processed.
