 Feedback
 Summarize this article for me
-Organizations preparing for Microsoft 365 Copilot often need time to review SharePoint sites, validate permissions, and implement governance controls before making content broadly discoverable. Restricted Content Discovery (RCD) helps you limit discovery of content from specific SharePoint sites while those reviews are taking place.
-When you enable Restricted Content Discovery for a site, content from that site doesn't appear in organization-wide search and Microsoft 365 Copilot experiences unless a user recently interacted with the content. This restriction helps reduce the likelihood of accidental discovery of content while permissions and governance controls are being evaluated.
+Organizations preparing for Microsoft 365 Copilot often need time to review SharePoint sites, validate permissions, and implement governance controls before making content broadly discoverable. Restricted Content Discovery (RCD) helps you limit discovery of content from specific SharePoint sites, including recently interacted files, in organization-wide search results and Microsoft 365 Copilot responses while those reviews are taking place.
+RCD also removes AI-powered entry points from these SharePoint sites. Users don't see entry points such as the Copilot button, AI actions menus (including creating agents), or
+Create pages with AI
+. This restriction helps reduce the likelihood of accidental discovery of content while permissions and governance controls are being evaluated.
 When a site has a Restricted Content Discovery policy applied to it, a Restricted tag is visible, as shown in the following screenshot:
 Restricted Content Discovery is designed as a temporary governance control that gives organizations time to review and right-size access while continuing their Copilot deployment.
